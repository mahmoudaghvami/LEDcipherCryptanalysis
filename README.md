# LEDcipherCryptanalysis

## Overview
This repository implements a 4-round LED cipher with encryption and decryption functions, along with tools for cryptanalysis.

## Key Features
- 4-round LED encryption/decryption.

## Files
- `LEDalgorithm.cpp` & `LEDalgorithm.h`: LED cipher algorithm implementation.
- `LEDcipherCryptanalysis.vcxproj`: Visual Studio project file for compilation.
- `XorProfileGenerator.cpp` & `XorProfileGenerator.h`: Tools for XOR profile generation.
- `XorProfile.txt`: Contains XOR profile data.

## Purpose
This repository is designed for cryptanalysis of the LED cipher, providing resources for researchers and developers interested in lightweight ciphers.
